### üìÇ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Other tools**: FontAwesome (for icons), Git for version control

‚öôÔ∏è Server & Database Architecture
The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and it uses MySQL to store user comments. Below is an overview of how the system works:

### üîÑ Data Flow
The user submits a comment through the frontend form.

The frontend sends a POST request to an Express API endpoint.

The server validates the data and saves it in the comments table in MySQL.

On page load, the server fetches existing comments via a SELECT query and sends them to the frontend for display.

### üìÅ Server Structure
![Database example](images/database.png)
server.js: Main entry point for the Express server.

routes/comments.js: Handles routes related to user comments.

db.js: Manages the MySQL database connection (using mysql2 or mysql npm package).



## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
2. Install the dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies:

cd your-repo
npm install
3. Set up the database
Create a MySQL database called blog_comments and a table to store the comments:


CREATE TABLE comments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
4. Start the server
Run the server with the following command:


npm start
Access the site at http://localhost:3000.

üí° Additional Features
Dark Mode üåô
You can activate dark mode by clicking on the moon üåô icon in the navigation menu. Dark mode improves readability in low-light environments.

Comment Section üìù
Users can leave comments in the dedicated section. Each comment is saved to the database and displayed dynamically.

New Cards üî•
Add "cards" to display other related articles or content. Each card can include an image, a title, and a brief description.
